this repository has been created on my computer (i.e vadersys/parth etc)
you will have to make necessary changes to various files in this repository in order to compile it.
yeah its cumbersome.
also, please install ros indigo only with qt4
no need for nasty dependency issues
all commits should go to your own branch with the syntax as follows :

"<name>-branch"

refrain from merging it with the master branch without my approval

new help will be added as soon as its needed.
